They can be burned, although they're not especially vulnerable to it. I'd choose cold magic, myself.\n\nThey attack by sticking their pincers in you and vibrating your body with sonic blasts. They can also entangle you in sticky silk that will sap your energy, but they have to be pretty close to do that, so try to keep your distance.\n\nThat's all you need to know.

Kur has always been a land of mystery to us, for it is too cold to support true life -- mantis life. But this cave was warmer! And so we sent in two squads of servant mantises to subdue the caves. Instead... they took up residence among the other creatures. They rebelled! This was a huge setback to teleportation magic, and even today I dare not send more mantises into that cave. But you and your friends will not be tricked by whatever wonders lie in there! You can complete the original mission from years ago! I have bribed the teleportation technician to send you there, so long as you ask quickly.\n\n<i>[A group of 3+ level 40+ players is recommended.]</i>",

After you have checked in to both crystals in that area, you will gain access to the reward cache located at the area entrance. Look through what's in there and pick out whatever looks interesting to you.\n\nIf you manage to complete all the tasks on the list, you may return to Serbule Keep and access the Grand Reward Cache located in a building across from the Inn for something much nicer! \n\nWe currently require the following areas to be serviced: \n- The Serbule Crypt \n- Borghild \n- Eltibule Keep Goblin Dungeon \n- Kur Tower \n- Ilmari Labyrinth \n- Gazluk Keep  \n\nAlso, once you have completed The Serbule Crypt or Borghild, you will gain access to the Civil Service Travel Network, which will help you get the job done faster! \n\nIf you choose to accept some or all of these tasks, thank you for your service and good hunting!",
